# Machine Learning by Stanford University (Coursera)
Here I have provided my solutions for the Programming exercises of each week along with the Lecture Slides.
I do not claim my solutions to be the most efficient ones possible, but they work correctly.
I solved the exercises using GNU Octave 5.1.0 and hence may contain Octave specific syntax which will have to be changed for MATLAB compatibility.

PLEASE TRY TO SOLVE THE EXERCISES BY YOURSELF FIRST.
